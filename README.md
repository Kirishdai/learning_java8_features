## üìÅ Folder Overview

### `01_Lambda`
- `ForEachMethodDemo.java`: Demonstrates the use of lambda expressions with the enhanced `forEach()` method on a list.
- `LambdaExpressionDemo.java`: Introduces lambda expressions for simplifying anonymous function implementation.

### `02_FunctionalInterfaces`
- `ConsumerInterfaceDemo.java`: Shows how to use the built-in `Consumer<T>` functional interface to process values using the `accept()` method.

### `03_MethodReference`
- `NewMethodReferencesDemo.java`: Demonstrates method references with a custom functional interface and static method binding using `ClassName::methodName`.

### `04_Default_Static_Interface`
- `DefaultStaticMethodsDemo.java`: Explains how to define `default` and `static` methods inside interfaces and invoke them properly.

### `05_StreamAPI`
- `StreamApiDemo.java`: Uses the Stream API to filter, map, and collect data from a list, showcasing both intermediate and terminal operations.

### `06_DateTimeAPI`
- `NewDateTimeApiDemo.java`: Demonstrates usage of `LocalTime`, `LocalDate`, and `ZonedDateTime` for date-time operations using Java's modern `java.time` package.

##  Why This Repo Exists

This repository is part of my structured, no-fluff 4-month sprint to master Java for real-world full-stack development. Java 8 introduced some of the most transformative features in the language‚Äôs history ‚Äî lambda expressions, functional interfaces, streams, and the new date-time API. Each file in this repo is designed to reinforce those foundations with clarity and purpose.
